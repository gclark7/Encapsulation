--Strategy
    Develop Separate Classes to perform specified duties
        GUI --> Builds the GUI and assigns button function methods
            Button function will call methods from a governing Class
        
        SortData --> Defines methods to sort the data
            Methods will be called from GUI buttons
            Methods will use getters from StoreData

        StoreData --> Stores data & values from GUI
            Public methods for getters & setters
            Methods will be called from GUI & from SortData

        SearchData --> Defines methods to search data values 
            Methods produce search results from the StoreData Class getters


        Perhaps build a GUI ErrorClass --> Handles application specific error handling 
            Methods would ensure data integrity
                Check user values
                Ensure partNumber formatting
                Check all fields are filled out
                
            //removed sort and search and used StoreData
//would be a good idea to create a Part Class to define parts
